this is without using react query where we have to handle the useState for isLoading , error seperately 
by using react query
use mutation is a hook that 
1) exposes the mutate function you call when you want to run underlying async function createUserAccount function
2) Tracks loading, error, and success status for you.
3) Gives you hooks like isLoading, isError, data, and callback options 

how caching matters
React Query fetches posts from the server (fetchPosts).It saves them in the cache. The UI displays them immediately. If the user stays on this screen — React Query won't hit the server again every second. ⚡ Fast and efficient.

A new post is added on the server. React Query is told: “Hey, that cached "posts" is now outdated.” It marks the cached data as stale.
On the next render, or refocus, or interaction — React Query will refetch and update the cache.

Pagination means breaking up a large set of data into smaller chunks or “pages”, so that you load and display it piece by piece, not all at once.
